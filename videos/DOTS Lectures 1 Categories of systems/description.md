## Problem â†’ Solution
Traditional approaches to studying dynamical systems often treat them in isolation, but real-world systems are coupled and compositional. How can we develop a unified mathematical framework for understanding both individual systems and their interactions? This lecture introduces the Double Operadic Theory of Systems (DOTS), using category theory to provide a compositional approach to studying coupled dynamical systems.
