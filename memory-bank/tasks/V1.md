Video ID: kZ4muU5Wc_4
Title: [DOTS Lectures] 1. Categories of systems
Speaker: David Jaz Myers (Topos Institute)
Duration: 42m 23s
Topic: Inaugural lecture on compositional theory of systems using category theory

Used the essential 5-step workflow from /Users/deepak/Movies/docs/yt-video-workflow.md successfully. All required files created with proper formatting and structure. Project relocated to /Users/deepak/code/category-theory/videos/ and memory bank system initialized for category theory research project.
