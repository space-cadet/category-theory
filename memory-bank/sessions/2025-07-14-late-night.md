## Focus Task
V2: DOTS Lectures 2 Video Processing
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 47 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### V2: DOTS Lectures 2 Video Processing
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created complete V2 task file with video metadata and progress tracking
- Enhanced yt-video-workflow.md with full Python path for yt-dlp and improved jq processing
- Refined transcript-verification-prompt.md for streamlined verification process
- Refined video-transcription-prompt.md with better mathematical notation guidelines
- Completed full video processing including transcript, details, and description files
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ ACTIVE â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `memory-bank/tasks/V2.md` - Created complete task file for DOTS Lectures 2
- `docs/yt-video-workflow.md` - Enhanced yt-dlp commands and transcript processing workflow
- `prompts/transcript-verification-prompt.md` - Streamlined verification methodology
- `prompts/video-transcription-prompt.md` - Improved LaTeX and timestamp guidelines
- `videos/DOTS Lectures 2 More categories of systems/` - Complete video processing output

## Key Decisions Made
- Standardized video processing workflow with full Python paths for reliability
- Refined prompts for better mathematical content handling
- Established systematic approach for video series processing

## Context for Next Session
V2 video processing complete. Video workflow documentation now enhanced for future DOTS lectures. All prompts refined for mathematical content transcription.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Continue with next DOTS lecture in series if available
2. Review and improve transcription quality based on V2 experience
3. Consider automation opportunities for video series processing
