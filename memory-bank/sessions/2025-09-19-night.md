## Focus Task
T1: Getting Started with Haskell
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: ~45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### T1: Getting Started with Haskell
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Explored Haskell installation methods (GHCup, Homebrew, Stack)
- Learned basic syntax, function definitions, and pattern matching
- Understood recursion concepts and advantages in Haskell
- Created Python and Haskell performance comparison programs
- Fixed compilation errors and Python string conversion limits
- Ran comprehensive benchmarks comparing factorial implementations
- Created detailed documentation with all findings and code examples
**Status Change**: NEW → ✅ COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `implementation-details/haskell-getting-started.md` - Created comprehensive Haskell tutorial with benchmarks
- `factorial_test.py` - Python performance test script with fixes for large integers
- `factorial_test.hs` - Haskell performance test with multiple implementation approaches
- `tasks/T1.md` - Individual task file documenting completion
- `tasks.md` - Updated master task registry with T1 entry

## Key Decisions Made
- Chose GHCup as recommended installation method for comprehensive toolchain
- Implemented multiple factorial approaches to demonstrate recursion concepts
- Fixed type ambiguity in Haskell code with explicit Double annotation
- Added sys.set_int_max_str_digits() to handle Python large integer conversions
- Documented performance findings showing Python speed vs Haskell recursion advantages

## Context for Next Session
Haskell fundamentals complete. Next logical steps could include:
- Exploring more advanced Haskell concepts (monads, type classes)
- Category theory applications in Haskell
- Practical Haskell projects
- Integration with existing category theory studies

## Next Session Priorities
1. Review category theory materials for Haskell connections
2. Explore algebraic data types and functors in Haskell
3. Consider practical applications for category theory project
