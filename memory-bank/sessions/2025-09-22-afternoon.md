## Focus Task
T3a: Milewski CTFP Book Chapter Extraction
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: ~17 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### T3a: Milewski CTFP Book Chapter Extraction
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Analyzed PDF structure and extracted table of contents using pdftotext
- Calculated PDF page offset by finding Chapter 1 start (logical page 2 = PDF page 20, offset = 18)
- Extracted all 31 chapters using qpdf with precise page ranges
- Corrected Chapter 28 page range and extracted missing chapters 29-31
- Extracted end matter (appendices, index, acknowledgments) from logical page 474 to end
- Verified all 32 files (31 chapters + end matter) created successfully in docs/CTFP/
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `docs/CTFP/Chapter_01_Category_The_Essence_of_Composition.pdf` through `Chapter_31_Monads_Monoids_and_Categories.pdf` - Created all 31 individual chapter PDF files
- `docs/CTFP/End_Matter.pdf` - Created end matter PDF with appendices and index
- `memory-bank/tasks/T3a.md` - Created individual task file with complete documentation
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added T3a task entry and updated T3 timestamp
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/pdf-chapter-extraction-workflow.md` - Enhanced workflow with end matter extraction and CTFP example

## Key Decisions Made
- Used qpdf for precise PDF page extraction rather than other tools for reliability
- Followed established naming convention Chapter_XX_Title.pdf for consistency
- Corrected Chapter 28 range when user identified missing chapters 29-31
- Extracted end matter separately to capture all non-chapter content

## Context for Next Session
Task T3a is now complete. The entire CTFP book has been successfully broken down into manageable individual chapter files for easier study and reference. This supports the broader T3 task of comprehensive category theory resource collection.

### T3b: PDF Text Extraction Using CLI
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Researched and compared PDF text extraction tools including pdftotext, pdfplumber, Mathpix, Pix2Text
- Evaluated tools for preserving mathematical expressions and document structure
- Set up Pix2Text as open-source alternative to Mathpix using UV virtual environment
- Created comprehensive documentation in pdf-cli-content-extraction.md
- Encountered CLI syntax issues with p2t command requiring -i flag
**Status Change**: â¬œ NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Additional Files Modified
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/pdf-cli-content-extraction.md` - Created comprehensive tool comparison and setup documentation
- `pix2text-env/` - Created UV virtual environment for Pix2Text
- `memory-bank/tasks/T3b.md` - Created individual task file for PDF text extraction

## Updated Context for Next Session
Completed T3a chapter extraction and started T3b for text extraction from PDF content. Pix2Text tool is set up but needs CLI syntax debugging to properly extract structured text with mathematical expressions.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Debug Pix2Text CLI syntax errors and test extraction on first 20 pages
2. Evaluate extraction quality and mathematical formula preservation
3. Complete full document extraction if quality is acceptable
4. Continue with T3 task organization and analysis
