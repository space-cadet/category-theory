## Focus Task
V1: DOTS Lectures 1 Video Processing - Transcription Enhancement
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 30 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### V1: DOTS Lectures 1 Video Processing
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Enhanced video transcription prompt with LaTeX commutative diagrams using \begin{CD}...\end{CD} format
- Added timestamp requirement for all section headings with source verification
- Implemented multiple block edit approach for better version control
- Completed first 20 minutes of DOTS Lectures 1 transcription with proper LaTeX formatting
- Applied filler utterance removal ("uh", "um", "ah") and paragraph structure improvements
- Added accurate timestamp labels verified against source transcript
- Corrected timestamp placement errors and ensured consistency with actual video timing
**Status Change**: IN PROGRESS → ✅ COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `docs/video-transcription-prompt.md` - Enhanced with LaTeX diagrams, timestamps, and multi-edit instructions
- `videos/DOTS Lectures 1 Categories of systems/DOTS Lectures 1 Categories of systems.md` - Transcribed 0:00-20:08 with professional formatting

## Key Decisions Made
- Standardized on LaTeX \begin{CD}...\end{CD} format for commutative diagrams instead of ASCII art
- Implemented timestamp verification against source transcript to prevent timing errors
- Adopted multiple block edit approach for complex transcription work to improve error handling

## Session Extension: Transcript Verification
**Extension Time**: 2025-07-14 00:11:11 IST
**Additional Progress**:
- Completed systematic paragraph-by-paragraph verification of DOTS Lectures 1 transcription
- Created comprehensive transcript verification prompt template in `prompts/transcript-verification-prompt.md`
- Identified and corrected missing content in early paragraphs with proper timestamps
- Discovered transcription ended prematurely at ~39:00 mark instead of full 42+ minute lecture
- Extended transcription to completion with final ~3 minutes of content including ODE trajectories and representability
- Task V1 now fully completed covering entire 42+ minute lecture

## Additional Files Modified
- `prompts/transcript-verification-prompt.md` - Created systematic verification methodology
- `videos/DOTS Lectures 1 Categories of systems/DOTS Lectures 1 Categories of systems.md` - Completed final section from 39:59-42:19

## Context for Next Session
DOTS Lectures 1 transcription now completely finished with full 42+ minute coverage, verified accuracy, and professional LaTeX formatting. Ready to process additional videos in series or begin developing category theory documentation structure.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Process next video in DOTS lecture series using established workflow
2. Begin developing category theory concept documentation structure
3. Consider creating searchable index of mathematical concepts from transcribed lectures
