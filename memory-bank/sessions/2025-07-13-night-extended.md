## Focus Task
V1: DOTS Lectures 1 Video Processing - Transcription Enhancement
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 30 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### V1: DOTS Lectures 1 Video Processing
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Enhanced video transcription prompt with LaTeX commutative diagrams using \begin{CD}...\end{CD} format
- Added timestamp requirement for all section headings with source verification
- Implemented multiple block edit approach for better version control
- Completed first 20 minutes of DOTS Lectures 1 transcription with proper LaTeX formatting
- Applied filler utterance removal ("uh", "um", "ah") and paragraph structure improvements
- Added accurate timestamp labels verified against source transcript
- Corrected timestamp placement errors and ensured consistency with actual video timing
**Status Change**: IN PROGRESS → ✅ COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `docs/video-transcription-prompt.md` - Enhanced with LaTeX diagrams, timestamps, and multi-edit instructions
- `videos/DOTS Lectures 1 Categories of systems/DOTS Lectures 1 Categories of systems.md` - Transcribed 0:00-20:08 with professional formatting

## Key Decisions Made
- Standardized on LaTeX \begin{CD}...\end{CD} format for commutative diagrams instead of ASCII art
- Implemented timestamp verification against source transcript to prevent timing errors
- Adopted multiple block edit approach for complex transcription work to improve error handling

## Context for Next Session
Video transcription workflow now fully established with professional LaTeX formatting and accurate timing. Ready to continue with next 20 minutes of DOTS Lectures 1 or process additional videos in the series.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Continue transcribing DOTS Lectures 1 from 20:00-40:00 mark using enhanced workflow
2. Consider transcribing additional videos in DOTS lecture series
3. Begin developing category theory concept documentation structure
