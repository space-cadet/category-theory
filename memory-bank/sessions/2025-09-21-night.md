## Focus Task
T2: Knowledge Graph Generation System
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T2: Knowledge Graph Generation System
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created comprehensive Python knowledge graph generator using spaCy NLP and NetworkX
- Implemented domain-aware category theory vocabulary (50+ specialized terms)
- Built interactive 2D/3D visualizations using Plotly with hover details and centrality mapping
- Generated static PNG visualization using matplotlib for publication use
- Created multi-format export system (GraphML for Gephi/Cytoscape, JSON for web apps)
- Processed 13 category theory documents extracting 1187 unique concepts
- Built knowledge graph with 107 nodes and 3504 edges (0.618 density)
- Generated comprehensive analysis report with centrality measures and community detection
- Created automated setup script and comprehensive documentation
**Status Change**: NEW → ✅ COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `knowledge-graph/kg_generator.py` - Main Python script with comprehensive NLP and graph generation
- `knowledge-graph/README.md` - Complete documentation with usage instructions and features
- `knowledge-graph/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies specification
- `knowledge-graph/setup.sh` - Automated setup script for dependencies and spaCy model
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/analysis_report.md` - Generated analysis with statistics
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/concept_frequency.json` - Concept frequency data
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/document_concepts.json` - Document-concept mappings
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.html` - Interactive 2D visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph_3d.html` - Interactive 3D visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.png` - Static visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.graphml` - Graph data export

## Key Decisions Made
- Used spaCy for advanced NLP processing with custom entity recognition for mathematical terms
- Implemented co-occurrence analysis for relationship detection rather than syntactic parsing
- Created 3D visualization with centrality-based positioning for enhanced exploration
- Chose frequency-based filtering (min 2 occurrences) to balance comprehensiveness with relevance
- Designed modular architecture supporting multiple export formats for different use cases

## Context for Next Session
Knowledge graph generation system is complete and functional. Generated comprehensive visualization of category theory concept relationships. System ready for use on documentation updates or extension to other mathematical domains.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Review generated knowledge graph visualizations and analysis
2. Consider integration with existing documentation workflow
3. Explore potential enhancements (citation networks, temporal analysis)
