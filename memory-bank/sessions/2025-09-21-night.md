## Focus Task
T2: Knowledge Graph Generation System
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T2: Knowledge Graph Generation System
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created comprehensive Python knowledge graph generator using spaCy NLP and NetworkX
- Implemented domain-aware category theory vocabulary (50+ specialized terms)
- Built interactive 2D/3D visualizations using Plotly with hover details and centrality mapping
- Generated static PNG visualization using matplotlib for publication use
- Created multi-format export system (GraphML for Gephi/Cytoscape, JSON for web apps)
- Processed 13 category theory documents extracting 1187 unique concepts
- Built knowledge graph with 107 nodes and 3504 edges (0.618 density)
- Generated comprehensive analysis report with centrality measures and community detection
- Created automated setup script and comprehensive documentation
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `knowledge-graph/kg_generator.py` - Main Python script with comprehensive NLP and graph generation
- `knowledge-graph/README.md` - Complete documentation with usage instructions and features
- `knowledge-graph/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies specification
- `knowledge-graph/setup.sh` - Automated setup script for dependencies and spaCy model
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/analysis_report.md` - Generated analysis with statistics
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/concept_frequency.json` - Concept frequency data
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/document_concepts.json` - Document-concept mappings
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.html` - Interactive 2D visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph_3d.html` - Interactive 3D visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.png` - Static visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.graphml` - Graph data export

## Key Decisions Made
- Used spaCy for advanced NLP processing with custom entity recognition for mathematical terms
- Implemented co-occurrence analysis for relationship detection rather than syntactic parsing
- Created 3D visualization with centrality-based positioning for enhanced exploration
- Chose frequency-based filtering (min 2 occurrences) to balance comprehensiveness with relevance
- Designed modular architecture supporting multiple export formats for different use cases

## Context for Next Session
Knowledge graph generation system is complete and functional. Generated comprehensive visualization of category theory concept relationships. System ready for use on documentation updates or extension to other mathematical domains.

## Tasks Worked On (Continued)
### T3: Category Theory Documentation and Resource Collection
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Added complete Bartosz Milewski "Category Theory for Programmers" book in PDF, MD, and TXT formats
- Created 12 specialized category theory documentation files covering core concepts
- Added comprehensive monad documentation with programming examples and categorical definitions
- Created documentation for lenses, functors, adjoint functors, and coalgebraic concepts
- Integrated Windsurf workflow for markdown formatting automation
- Organized documentation structure under docs/ directory with CTFP subdirectory
- Removed outdated YouTube workflow files (yt-transcript-retrieval.md, yt-video-workflow.md)

## Key Decisions Made (Continued)
- Organized documentation into logical structure with dedicated CTFP directory for the comprehensive textbook
- Maintained multiple formats of CTFP book for different use cases (reading, searching, processing)
- Created specialized topic documentation to complement the main textbook
- Integrated Windsurf workflow to automate markdown formatting and processing
- Removed outdated YouTube workflow files as they're superseded by implementation-details documentation

### Additional Progress on T3: Category Theory Documentation
**Progress Made**:
- Examined all 12 original docs files and identified critical foundational gaps
- Located comprehensive category theory collection in typora-notes with 20+ relevant files
- Successfully copied 10 foundational files filling major gaps in basic concepts
- Added critical missing foundations: basic concepts, products/coproducts, limits/colimits
- Enhanced monad coverage with extended treatments and advanced topics
- Added comprehensive adjoint functor references and historical context
- Integrated Lawvere's work and categorical dynamics for advanced applications

**Files Added**:
- `docs/Basic Category Theory Concepts and Constructions.md` - 40 fundamental concepts

**Gap Analysis Resolution**: Approximately 40% of foundational gaps now filled, providing solid foundation for category theory learning progression.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Organize documentation into coherent learning flow based on dependencies
2. Review generated knowledge graph visualizations and analysis  
3. Consider integration with existing documentation workflow
4. Create cross-reference system between related documents
