## Focus Task
T2: Knowledge Graph Generation System
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

## Tasks Worked On
### T2: Knowledge Graph Generation System
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Created comprehensive Python knowledge graph generator using spaCy NLP and NetworkX
- Implemented domain-aware category theory vocabulary (50+ specialized terms)
- Built interactive 2D/3D visualizations using Plotly with hover details and centrality mapping
- Generated static PNG visualization using matplotlib for publication use
- Created multi-format export system (GraphML for Gephi/Cytoscape, JSON for web apps)
- Processed 13 category theory documents extracting 1187 unique concepts
- Built knowledge graph with 107 nodes and 3504 edges (0.618 density)
- Generated comprehensive analysis report with centrality measures and community detection
- Created automated setup script and comprehensive documentation
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ âœ… COMPLETED

## Files Modified
- `knowledge-graph/kg_generator.py` - Main Python script with comprehensive NLP and graph generation
- `knowledge-graph/README.md` - Complete documentation with usage instructions and features
- `knowledge-graph/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies specification
- `knowledge-graph/setup.sh` - Automated setup script for dependencies and spaCy model
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/analysis_report.md` - Generated analysis with statistics
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/concept_frequency.json` - Concept frequency data
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/document_concepts.json` - Document-concept mappings
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.html` - Interactive 2D visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph_3d.html` - Interactive 3D visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.png` - Static visualization
- `knowledge-graph/knowledge-graph/knowledge_graph.graphml` - Graph data export

## Key Decisions Made
- Used spaCy for advanced NLP processing with custom entity recognition for mathematical terms
- Implemented co-occurrence analysis for relationship detection rather than syntactic parsing
- Created 3D visualization with centrality-based positioning for enhanced exploration
- Chose frequency-based filtering (min 2 occurrences) to balance comprehensiveness with relevance
- Designed modular architecture supporting multiple export formats for different use cases

## Context for Next Session
Knowledge graph generation system is complete and functional. Generated comprehensive visualization of category theory concept relationships. System ready for use on documentation updates or extension to other mathematical domains.

## Tasks Worked On (Continued)
### T3: Category Theory Documentation and Resource Collection
**Priority**: HIGH
**Progress Made**:
- Added complete Bartosz Milewski "Category Theory for Programmers" book in PDF, MD, and TXT formats
- Created 12 specialized category theory documentation files covering core concepts
- Added comprehensive monad documentation with programming examples and categorical definitions
- Created documentation for lenses, functors, adjoint functors, and coalgebraic concepts
- Integrated Windsurf workflow for markdown formatting automation
- Organized documentation structure under docs/ directory with CTFP subdirectory
- Removed outdated YouTube workflow files (yt-transcript-retrieval.md, yt-video-workflow.md)
**Status Change**: NEW â†’ ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Files Modified (Continued)
- `docs/CTFP/Milewski_Category Theory for Programmers_2014.md` - Complete CTFP book in markdown
- `docs/CTFP/Milewski_Category Theory for Programmers_2014.pdf` - Original PDF format
- `docs/CTFP/Milewski_Category Theory for Programmers_2014.txt` - Plain text format
- `docs/Understanding Monads in Category Theory.md` - Comprehensive monad documentation
- `docs/Lenses and Optics in Category Theory.md` - Lenses and optical systems
- `docs/Exploring Adjoint Functors in Category Theory.md` - Adjoint functor theory
- `docs/Free Monoidal Functor Fundamentals.md` - Free monoidal structures
- `docs/Getting Started with Haskell.md` - Haskell programming basics
- `docs/Categorical Structure of Finite Lists.md` - List categorization
- `docs/Coalgebraic Lenses in Category Theory.md` - Coalgebraic approaches
- `docs/Composability and data structure immutability.md` - Compositional programming
- `docs/Introduction to K-Linear Categories.md` - K-linear category theory
- `docs/Programming Semantics Notation for "Algebras" and "Co-Algebras".md` - Algebraic semantics
- `docs/Representation Categories and the Jones Polynomial.md` - Representation theory
- `docs/When is a Category Lax Monoidal?.md` - Lax monoidal categories
- `.windsurf/workflows/format-as-md.md` - Windsurf markdown formatting workflow

## Key Decisions Made (Continued)
- Organized documentation into logical structure with dedicated CTFP directory for the comprehensive textbook
- Maintained multiple formats of CTFP book for different use cases (reading, searching, processing)
- Created specialized topic documentation to complement the main textbook
- Integrated Windsurf workflow to automate markdown formatting and processing
- Removed outdated YouTube workflow files as they're superseded by implementation-details documentation

## Next Session Priorities
1. Create comprehensive implementation details documentation for category theory resources
2. Review generated knowledge graph visualizations and analysis  
3. Consider integration with existing documentation workflow
4. Explore potential enhancements (citation networks, temporal analysis)
