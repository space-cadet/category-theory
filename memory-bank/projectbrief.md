# Category Theory Research Project

*Last Updated: 2025-07-13 23:05:04 IST*

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to studying and documenting category theory, with a particular focus on compositional theory of systems and the Double Operadic Theory of Systems (DOTS). The project aims to build a comprehensive knowledge base covering foundational category theory concepts and their applications to dynamical systems.

## Key Objectives

1. **Video Content Processing**: Extract, transcribe, and analyze category theory lectures and presentations
2. **Knowledge Documentation**: Create detailed transcriptions and explanatory materials for complex mathematical concepts
3. **Research Archive**: Build a structured repository of category theory resources, papers, and educational materials
4. **Compositional Systems Study**: Focus on understanding coupled dynamical systems through categorical methods

## Current Focus

- Processing DOTS lecture series by David Jaz Myers from Topos Institute
- Developing efficient video-to-knowledge workflows
- Creating high-fidelity transcriptions with proper mathematical notation
- Building foundation for advanced category theory study

## Resources

### Primary Sources
- Topos Institute lectures and materials
- David Jaz Myers' work on compositional theory of systems
- Brendan Fong's decorated cospans research
- John Baez's work on structured co-spans
