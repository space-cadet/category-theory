# Representation Categories and the Jones Polynomial

I want to know more about representation categories, for example how does Rep(SU(2)) lead to the Jones polynomial?

I'd be happy to explain representation categories and their connection to the Jones polynomial. This is a fascinating area where abstract algebra connects to knot theory.

## Representation Categories

A representation category, or Rep(G) for a group G, is the category whose:

- Objects are representations of G
- Morphisms are maps between representations that commute with the G-action

For Rep(SU(2)) specifically, we're looking at the category of representations of the special unitary group in 2 dimensions. The irreducible representations of SU(2) are particularly well-understood:

- They're indexed by half-integers $j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, \dots$
- Each irreducible representation $V_j$ has dimension $2j+1$
- They correspond to spin-j representations in physics

## Connection to the Jones Polynomial

The connection between Rep(SU(2)) and the Jones polynomial involves several key steps:

1. **Quantum groups**: The Jones polynomial actually comes from a deformation of Rep(SU(2)), denoted $U_q(sl_2)$, where $q$ is a complex parameter.
2. **Temperley-Lieb algebra**: This algebra arises as the endomorphism algebra of certain objects in this category.
3. **Braiding structure**: The category has a braiding, which gives a representation of the braid group.
4. **Skein relations**: The Jones polynomial satisfies skein relations that can be derived from the representation theory.

The key insight is that quantum SU(2) representations provide a framework for constructing knot invariants. When we evaluate certain quantum traces in these representations, we get the Jones polynomial.

Would you like me to go deeper into any specific aspect of this connection? For instance, I could explain more about quantum groups, how the braid group representations arise, or the specific construction of the Jones polynomial from these representations.

## Mathematical Steps from Rep(SU(2)) to the Jones Polynomial

I'll walk through the mathematical steps connecting Rep(SU(2)) to the Jones polynomial:

1. **Quantum Deformation**
   First, we need to deform SU(2) to obtain the quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$, where $q$ is a complex parameter:
   
   $U_q(sl_2)$ is generated by elements $E$, $F$, $K$, $K^{-1}$ satisfying:
   $$KK^{-1} = K^{-1}K = 1$$
   $$KEK^{-1} = q^2E$$
   $$KFK^{-1} = q^{-2}F$$
   $$EF - FE = \frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$$

2. **Representation Category $Rep(U_q(sl_2))$**
   The representation theory of $U_q(sl_2)$ parallels that of $SU(2)$ when $q$ is not a root of unity:
   
   - Irreducible representations $V_n$ are indexed by $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$
   - Each $V_n$ has dimension $n+1$
   - The tensor product decomposition follows:
     $$V_m \otimes V_n \cong \bigoplus_{k=|m-n|}^{m+n} V_k$$
     where $k$ increases by 2

3. **Ribbon Category Structure**
   $Rep(U_q(sl_2))$ is a ribbon category, meaning it has:
   
   - A braiding isomorphism $c_{V,W}: V \otimes W \to W \otimes V$
   - A twist $\theta_V: V \to V$
   - Duality morphisms (evaluation and coevaluation)
   
   The braiding gives a representation of the braid group:
   $$\sigma_i \mapsto id_{V_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes c_{V_i,V_{i+1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes id_{V_n}$$

4. **Temperley-Lieb Algebra**
   For $q = e^{\pi i/4}$, we obtain the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n(d)$ with $d = -q - q^{-1} = -\sqrt{2}$:
   
   - Generators: $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_{n-1}$
   - Relations:
     $$e_i^2 = de_i$$
     $$e_ie_j = e_je_i \quad \text{for } |i-j| \geq 2$$
     $$e_ie_{i\pm 1}e_i = e_i$$

5. **Kauffman Bracket**
   The Kauffman bracket $\langle L \rangle$ is defined recursively:
   
   - $\langle \text{positive crossing} \rangle = q\langle \text{horizontal resolution} \rangle - q^2\langle \text{vertical resolution} \rangle$
   - $\langle \text{negative crossing} \rangle = q^{-1}\langle \text{horizontal resolution} \rangle - q^{-2}\langle \text{vertical resolution} \rangle$
   - $\langle \text{unknot} \rangle = \frac{q^2 + q^{-2}}{q + q^{-1}}$

6. **Jones Polynomial**
   The Jones polynomial $V_L(t)$ of a link $L$ is obtained from the Kauffman bracket by:
   $$V_L(t) = (-A)^{-3w(L)}\langle L \rangle|_{A = t^{-1/4}}$$
   where $w(L)$ is the writhe of $L$.

7. **From Representation Theory to the Jones Polynomial**
   The explicit construction uses quantum traces:
   
   - Represent a link $L$ as the closure of a braid $\beta \in B_n$
   - Map $\beta$ to an endomorphism $\rho(\beta) \in End(V_1^{\otimes n})$ using the $U_q(sl_2)$ representation
   - Take the quantum trace: $J_L(q) = tr_q(\rho(\beta))$
   - The Jones polynomial is obtained by substituting $t = q^4$

This construction demonstrates how the algebraic structure of $Rep(U_q(sl_2))$ encodes topological information about knots and links through the Jones polynomial.

## Rep(SU(2)) vs. Rep(U_q(sl_2))

You've raised an excellent point. Let me clarify this important distinction:

### Rep(SU(2))
The representation category Rep(SU(2)) by itself does not have a braiding structure in the sense needed for knot invariants. While Rep(SU(2)) is a tensor category (meaning we can take tensor products of representations), it has a simple symmetric structure rather than a genuine braiding.

In Rep(SU(2)):

- The "swap" map $V \otimes W \to W \otimes V$ given by $v \otimes w \mapsto w \otimes v$ is just the usual vector space swap
- This swap satisfies $c_{V,W} \circ c_{W,V} = id_{W \otimes V}$, making it a symmetric monoidal category
- This symmetry means we cannot distinguish between over-crossings and under-crossings in knot diagrams

### Rep(U_q(sl_2))
The quantum deformation Rep(U_q(sl_2)) is what provides the crucial braiding structure:

- The braiding $c_{V,W}: V \otimes W \to W \otimes V$ is non-trivial
- Crucially, $c_{V,W} \circ c_{W,V} \neq id_{W \otimes V}$ in general
- This non-symmetry allows us to distinguish over-crossings from under-crossings

This is precisely why we need the quantum deformation to get the Jones polynomial. The quantum parameter $q$ introduces the asymmetry in the braiding that allows us to capture knot information.

In summary, you're absolutely correct - Rep(SU(2)) itself doesn't have the braiding structure needed for knot invariants. The quantum deformation to Rep(U_q(sl_2)) is the essential step that introduces the non-symmetric braiding required to define the Jones polynomial.

## Full Definition of $U_q(sl_2)$

$U_q(sl_2)$ is the quantum universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $sl_2$. It's defined as follows:

### Generators and Relations
$U_q(sl_2)$ is a Hopf algebra over $\mathbb{C}(q)$ generated by four elements $E$, $F$, $K$, and $K^{-1}$ subject to the following relations:

1. $KK^{-1} = K^{-1}K = 1$ (inverse relation)
2. $KEK^{-1} = q^2E$ (or equivalently, $KE = q^2EK$)
3. $KFK^{-1} = q^{-2}F$ (or equivalently, $KF = q^{-2}FK$)
4. $EF - FE = \frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$ (deformed commutation relation)

### Hopf Algebra Structure
The coalgebra structure is defined by:

1. **Coproduct** $\Delta$:
   - $\Delta(E) = E \otimes K + 1 \otimes E$
   - $\Delta(F) = F \otimes 1 + K^{-1} \otimes F$
   - $\Delta(K) = K \otimes K$
   - $\Delta(K^{-1}) = K^{-1} \otimes K^{-1}$

2. **Counit** $\epsilon$:
   - $\epsilon(E) = \epsilon(F) = 0$
   - $\epsilon(K) = \epsilon(K^{-1}) = 1$

3. **Antipode** $S$:
   - $S(E) = -EK^{-1}$
   - $S(F) = -KF$
   - $S(K) = K^{-1}$
   - $S(K^{-1}) = K$

### R-matrix
The braiding structure comes from the universal R-matrix, which satisfies:
$$R\Delta(x)R^{-1} = \Delta^{op}(x) \text{ for all } x \in U_q(sl_2)$$
where $\Delta^{op}$ is the opposite coproduct.

The explicit form of the R-matrix is:
$$R = q^{H \otimes H/2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(1 - q^{-2})^n}{[n]_q!} q^{n(n-1)/2} (q^{n/2}E)^n \otimes (q^{-n/2}F)^n$$

## Why $sl_2$ Instead of SU(2)?

The quantum deformation process that leads to the Jones polynomial specifically requires:

1. Working with the universal enveloping algebra (which is already an infinite-dimensional object)
2. Deforming the algebraic relations (which is more natural in the complex setting)
3. The $sl_2$ framework allows for the mathematical machinery of quantum groups to work properly

In essence, to get from Rep(SU(2)) to knot invariants like the Jones polynomial, we must first pass to the complex setting of $sl_2$, which provides the appropriate algebraic structure that can then be quantized to $U_q(sl_2)$.

This transition from the compact real form SU(2) to the complex form SL(2,ℂ) (whose Lie algebra is $sl_2$) is a standard step in representation theory when more algebraic flexibility is needed.

## Equivalence Between Rep(SU(2)) and Finite-Dimensional Representations of su(2)

This equivalence comes from several key mathematical facts:

1. **Differentiation Process**
   For any Lie group G with Lie algebra g, there's a functor:
   
   - Differentiation: Rep(G) → Rep(g)
   - Given a representation $\rho: G \to GL(V)$, we get a representation $d\rho: g \to gl(V)$
   - This works by taking the derivative at the identity: $d\rho(X) = \frac{d}{dt}[\rho(\exp(tX))]|_{t=0}$

2. **Integration Process**
   For compact Lie groups like SU(2), we can go in the reverse direction:
   
   - Integration: Rep(su(2)) → Rep(SU(2))
   - Given a representation of su(2), we can integrate it to get a unique representation of SU(2)
   - This works because SU(2) is simply connected (its fundamental group is trivial)

3. **Proof of Equivalence**
   The equivalence can be proven by showing:
   
   - Differentiation and integration are functors that preserve the categorical structure
   - They are inverses of each other (up to natural isomorphism)

## How Representations of su(2) Extend to sl(2,ℂ)

The extension works through complexification:

1. **Complexification Process**
   Given a real representation $\rho: su(2) \to gl(V)$ where V is a real vector space, we:
   
   - Complexify the vector space: $V_\mathbb{C} = V \otimes_\mathbb{R} \mathbb{C}$
   - Extend the representation linearly: $\rho_\mathbb{C}: su(2) \to gl(V_\mathbb{C})$
   - Further extend to $sl(2,\mathbb{C}) = su(2) \otimes_\mathbb{R} \mathbb{C}$ by complex linearity

2. **Explicit Construction**
   To see how this works concretely:
   
   - Standard basis correspondence:
     - su(2) has basis ${i\sigma_x, i\sigma_y, i\sigma_z}$ where $\sigma_i$ are Pauli matrices
     - sl(2,ℂ) has basis ${E, F, H}$ where:
       - H corresponds to $i\sigma_z$
       - E corresponds to $i\sigma_x + i\sigma_y$
       - F corresponds to $i\sigma_x - i\sigma_y$
   - For any representation $\rho$ of su(2) on a complex vector space V:
     - We already know $\rho(i\sigma_x)$, $\rho(i\sigma_y)$, $\rho(i\sigma_z)$
     - We define the extended representation $\tilde{\rho}$ on sl(2,ℂ) by:
       - $\tilde{\rho}(H) = \rho(i\sigma_z)$
       - $\tilde{\rho}(E) = \frac{1}{2}(\rho(i\sigma_x) - i\rho(i\sigma_y))$
       - $\tilde{\rho}(F) = \frac{1}{2}(\rho(i\sigma_x) + i\rho(i\sigma_y))$

3. **Preservation of Structure**
   This extension preserves the essential algebraic structure:
   
   - The commutation relations of sl(2,ℂ):
     $$[H,E] = 2E$$
     $$[H,F] = -2F$$
     $$[E,F] = H$$
   - These match the commutation relations of su(2) under the correspondence

4. **Properties of the Extension**
   Key properties of this extension:
   
   - Uniqueness: The extension from su(2) to sl(2,ℂ) is unique
   - Irreducibility: A representation is irreducible as an su(2) representation if and only if its extension is irreducible as an sl(2,ℂ) representation
   - Completeness: Every finite-dimensional representation of sl(2,ℂ) can be obtained this way
   - Tensor products: The extension of a tensor product is the tensor product of the extensions
